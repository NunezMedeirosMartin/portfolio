        <h2>Personal Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          I am a curious and dedicated person with a strong interest in
          continuously learning and growing professionally. I'm passionate about
          sports, audiovisual production, and content editing. I especially
          enjoy being in front of the computer exploring new tools,
          technologies, and creative ways to build. That blend between technical
          and creative defines a big part of who I am.

        <h2>Professional Profile</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently focused on software development, where I seek to apply
          my knowledge and constantly expand it. I'm motivated to be part of
          challenging projects where I can actively collaborate in building
          solutions and grow alongside others. I am perseverant, eager to build
          a solid professional path by contributing with responsibility,
          creativity, and dedication at every step. I'm interested in
          participating in projects with a positive impact, where I can continue
          to evolve as a developer and as a person.

        <h2>Values and Work Ethic</h2>
        <p>
          I believe teamwork is key, and I strive to foster a positive,
          respectful, and productive environment. I surround myself with
          proactive people who value effort, commitment, and constant
          self-improvement. I learn a lot from those around me: I’m inspired by
          their attitudes, drive, and ways of facing challenges. I firmly
          believe that growth is a collective journey, and being around
          motivated people fuels our own desire to improve.

        <h2>Career in Progress</h2>
        <p>
          I have currently completed the fourth semester of my degree. I am
          starting to take an elective course and will then begin my final
          project, which I am currently reflecting on and planning. I have
          learned a great deal throughout this degree program and am grateful to
          ORT University for the high-quality education it provides to its
          students. Not only has it taught me valuable skills, but it has also
          shown me how much there is still to learn. I am fully aware that ORT
          University has been a fundamental pillar in my education, equipping me
          with the tools to face this expansive world. I am eager and excited to
          dive in and apply what I have learned.
